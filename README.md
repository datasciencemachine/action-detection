It can viewed on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/action_recognition_with_tf_hub.ipynb), [github](https://github.com/datasciencemachine/action-detection/blob/master/action_recognition_with_tf_hub.ipynb) as well as [tensorflow_hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/action_recognition_with_tf_hub).

the [action detection on live video](https://github.com/datasciencemachine/action-detection/blob/master/action%20detection%20on%20live%20video.ipynb) could only be run on a local machine, as google colab cannot read local web camera. it has been created by using the [tensorflow_hub](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub) api. Before ussing certain [installations](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/installation.md) need to be performed.
